# Potato Disease Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, **Potato_Disease_Classification.ipynb**, which demonstrates a deep learning approach to classifying diseases in potato plants using computer vision techniques. The project focuses on preprocessing image data, extracting features, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately identify various potato diseases.

## Overview

Potato diseases can have a significant impact on crop yield and quality. Early detection through automated image analysis can help farmers take proactive measures. This project:
- Preprocesses and augments potato leaf images.
- Builds and trains a CNN model for disease classification.
- Evaluates model performance using standard metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
- Provides a framework that can be extended to other plant disease classification tasks.
